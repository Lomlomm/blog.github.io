# 2024 Developer Skills Report: Key Insights for Developers

As we all know, 2023 was a wild year for developers, since for many people this year represented layoffs and news about AI taking off our jobs. Hackerrank, a leading company to evaluate developer skills, took the task to analyze the available data to offer an answer to the question **what the heck is going on with the industry and developer skills?.** 


The 2024 Developer Skills Report of HackerRank provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the tech industry, the most in-demand programming languages, salary trends, and other crucial topics for developers. Here's a summary of the most important insights from the report.

## Industry Status

2023 was a tumultuous year for the tech industry, marked by layoffs and economic uncertainty. However, the second half of the year showed signs of stabilization:

- **Hiring Activity**: From July 2023, there was a significant increase in developer test invites (86%) and new test creations (58%), indicating a resurgence in hiring activity.

- **Optimism for 2024**: A majority of developers (68%) believe that 2024 will be a better year for the industry.

## Most Required Programming Languages

The demand for specific programming languages fluctuates based on industry needs and technological advancements:

- **1-Java and 2-Python**: These remain the top languages recruiters are looking for. Although demand for Java has declined, Python has gained traction, especially due to its association with AI.
- **3 C++**: It seems that our lovely C++ is not going anywhere as it continues on the top 3 programming languages.

About other skills, top three seemed to remain from 2022 and 2023, these are: 

- **1 AI/ML Skills**
- **2 React**
- **3 Angular**

## What drives developers?

Understanding what drives developers and what they value can help companies attract and retain talent:

- **Opportunity Over Security**: Contrary to what many executives believe, developers prioritize opportunities for growth over job security. This is a significant factor when considering job changes. Personally, I consider this is due to the fact that our industry (software) continues growing rapidly, new technologies emerge and with this, new skills are required to be competitive and even though having a seure job seems tempting, I bet every developer fulls with anxiety when feels they are not learning new technologies or dev skills. 

- **Top Incentives**: Higher pay is the leading incentive for developers to switch jobs, followed closely by career and learning opportunities.

## Education and Skills

The value of traditional education is being questioned as the tech industry evolves:

- **College Relevance**: 60% of developers and nearly half of recruiters do not believe a college degree is necessary for technical roles. Skills are what matter most.
- **Upskilling**: Companies that invest in upskilling see benefits in productivity and retention. However, only 22% of developers say they are regularly given time for learning new skills at work.

## Cutoffs and Hiring Trends

Several trends and data points indicate the current state and future direction of hiring in the tech industry:

- **Test Invites and Creations**: The increase in test invites and new test creations since July 2023 is a positive sign of hiring activity.
- **Market Stabilization**: External sources, such as US corporate profit data, also show signs of economic improvement, aligning with the trends observed in the tech hiring market.

## AI and Developer Tools

AI is rapidly transforming the way developers work:

- **Mainstream Adoption**: AI tools like ChatGPT have become widely used among developers, with 76% reporting using it for work.
- **Concerns**: Despite its benefits, there are concerns about AI-related plagiarism in technical assessments.

## Conclusion

The 2024 Developer Skills Report of highlights an industry in transition, with significant changes in hiring practices, the importance of skills over traditional education, and the growing influence of AI. Developers and companies alike must adapt to these changes to thrive in the evolving tech landscape. And even if your favorite programming language is not listed above, I'll recommend to keep doing great projects with it as this ranking doesn't mean that other languages are not required:).
